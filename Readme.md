# Pomodoro Time Keeper
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:

Pomodoro Time Keeper is a app based on the Pomodoro focus technique, 
to keep track of your pomodoros.
The Pomodoro technique consists of intervals of work, typically 30 minutes in length,
separated by short breaks, between 5 and 10 minutes.

Pomodoro Time Keeper allows you to keep track of the time in your interval while you do your tasks.
You can change the time of the work interval between 25, 30 and 45 minutes, the most common size
of intervals, also said to be the longest time a human can focus continuously.
You can also change the break time from 3,5 and 10 minutes, max at 10 minutes so that the temptation
of a long break is not there.
You can reset, skip and stop the current timer.
